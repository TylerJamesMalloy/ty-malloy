## Hello! 

My name is Tyler Malloy. I am currently a PhD student studying human and machine learning at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. One part of my research is in cognitive modelling, studying how humans learn and make decisions, particularly how they represent visual information while achieving these goals. My research in artificial intelligence focuses on human-inspired reinforcement learning, which is the project I am currently working on as a part of a scholarship funded by IBM Research AI.
