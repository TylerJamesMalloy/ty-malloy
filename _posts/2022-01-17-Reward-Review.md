title: "Is Reward Enough?"
categories: review
---

In this post I provide a review and opinion on the paper ["Reward Is Enough"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370221000862) by D Silver, S Singh, D Precup, and RS Sutton. In this work, the authors provide a broad perspective on reinforcement learning research and put forward the opinion that much of the behaviour that interests cognitive science and artificial intelligence researchers can be viewed in relation to reward. Specifically, they propose that many cognitive faculties such as language, generalization, imitation, and even general intelligence can be achieved through reward mazimization and experience in an environment. They propose a hypothesis alongside these claims that is essentially stated in the short title, that reward is enough to learn these types of complex behaviours.
