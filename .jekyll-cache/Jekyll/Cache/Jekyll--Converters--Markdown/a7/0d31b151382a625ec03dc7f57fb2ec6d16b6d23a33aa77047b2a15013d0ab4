I"¯<p>In this post I provide a review and opinion on the paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370221000862">‚ÄúReward Is Enough‚Äù</a> by D Silver, S Singh, D Precup, and RS Sutton. In this work, the authors provide a broad perspective on reinforcement learning research and put forward the opinion that much of the behavior that interests cognitive science and artificial intelligence researchers can be viewed in relation to reward. Specifically, they propose that many cognitive faculties such as perception, language, generalization, imitation, and even general intelligence can be achieved through reward maximization and experience in an environment. They describe a hypothesis alongside these claims that is essentially stated in the short title, that reward is enough to learn these types of complex behaviors. The following figure borrowed from the paper describes several phenomenon which could hypothetically be trained through reward based reinforcement style learning.</p>
