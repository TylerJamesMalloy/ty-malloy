I"O<p>Rather than look back at previous research I have done, as the previous posts on this blog have done, this post will look forward to my hopes for 2022 and new research ideas I am interested in. Firstly, the major plans for this year include completing the website hosting my thesis project, submitting a paper based on my work in Theory of Mind for reinforcement learning, and completing my PhD Thesis. Aside from that, on a more personal level I will be taking some time this year to look for possible post-doc positions or research centric positions in other areas. As a part of that I hope to continue with this blog and additionally go back to some of my previous posts and add a bit of information. Additionally I hope to expand on some of my background knowledge of other areas of cognitive science, psychology, and machine learning.</p>
